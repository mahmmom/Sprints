SmartCafe Assistant - README
===============================

PROGRAM STRUCTURE:
-----------------
This SmartCafe Assistant is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with a multi-agent architecture consisting of two main classes:

1. ChatBotAgent (ChatBotAgent.py)
   - Handles user interaction and conversation flow
   - Uses regex pattern matching to detect user intents
   - Routes user queries to the appropriate ResearchAgent methods
   - Manages the main conversation loop and user interface

2. ResearchAgent (ResearchAgent.py)
   - Loads and queries data from cafe_data.json
   - Contains specialized methods for different types of information retrieval
   - Handles all data processing and information extraction

3. Supporting Files:
   - main.py: Entry point that initializes and starts the ChatBotAgent
   - random_responses.py: Contains fallback responses for unrecognized queries
   - cafe_data.json: Knowledge base containing menu, pricing, and hours information

CLASS AND METHOD ROLES:
----------------------

ChatBotAgent Class:
- __init__(): Initializes the ResearchAgent dependency
- greet_user(): Displays welcome message and available options
- detect_intent(user_input): Uses regex to identify what the user is asking about
- route_response(user_input, intent): Directs queries to appropriate ResearchAgent methods
- start_conversation(): Main loop that handles continuous user interaction

ResearchAgent Class:
- __init__(): Loads the cafe_data.json file into memory
- list_drinks(): Returns a formatted list of available beverages
- list_opening_hours(): Returns formatted opening hours for all days
- get_price(user_input): Searches for drink prices based on user query
- get_ingredients(user_input): Returns ingredient lists for specific drinks
- get_nutrition(user_input): Provides nutritional information for drinks
- get_hours(user_input): Returns opening hours for specific days

REGEX USAGE FOR INTENT DETECTION:
--------------------------------
The ChatBotAgent uses regular expressions to detect user intents:

1. Price Intent: Patterns like 'price', 'cost', 'how much', '$'
   - Example: "How much does a latte cost?" → routes to get_price()

2. Ingredients Intent: Patterns like 'ingredient', 'made of', 'contains', 'what.*in'
   - Example: "What's in a mocha?" → routes to get_ingredients()

3. Nutrition Intent: Patterns like 'calorie', 'nutrition', 'sugar', 'healthy'
   - Example: "How many calories in hot chocolate?" → routes to get_nutrition()

4. Hours Intent: Patterns like 'hour', 'open', 'close', 'time', 'when'
   - Example: "When are you open on Friday?" → routes to get_hours()

5. Menu Intent: Patterns like 'menu', 'drink', 'beverage', 'what.*have', 'available'
   - Example: "What drinks do you have?" → routes to list_drinks()

6. Exit Intent: Patterns like 'exit', 'quit', 'bye', 'goodbye'
   - Example: "quit" → ends the conversation

The regex patterns use word boundaries (\b) and alternation (|) to match various ways users might phrase their questions naturally.

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
1. Ensure all files are in the same directory
2. Run: python3 main.py
3. Follow the prompts to ask questions about the cafe
4. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the conversation

SAMPLE INTERACTIONS:
-------------------
- "What's the price of a latte?" → Shows price information
- "What ingredients are in a mocha?" → Lists ingredients
- "How many calories in espresso?" → Shows nutritional info
- "What are your hours on Saturday?" → Shows Saturday hours
- "What drinks do you offer?" → Lists all available drinks

ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS:
---------------------
- Separation of Concerns: ChatBotAgent handles UI, ResearchAgent handles data
- Composition: ChatBotAgent depends on ResearchAgent for data operations
- Modularity: Each class has a specific responsibility
- Extensibility: Easy to add new intents or data sources
- Maintainability: Clean method structure and clear naming conventions
